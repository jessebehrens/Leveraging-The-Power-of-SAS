## Overview

The code in the hashobjects folder is meant to show SAS users an efficient way to join two datasets together outside of the data step match-merge and SQL join.  
   
Data step hash objects offer two distinct advantages:    
   1) They eliminate the need for preprocessing the data with indexes and sorts.     
   2) They have the <i>potential</i> to greatly reduce processing time.  

The examples in the hashobjects folder are designed to help the user learn hash objects and their syntax.  Additionally, I have provided a corresponding SQL procedure for each hash object method to serve as a comparison between the two techniques.
